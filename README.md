# MiniPythonParser

This is a project for my Mizzou Principles of Programming Languages class.

The goal is to write a parser for a small subset of python.

## Instructions
To use this project you must have [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) installed. 

To run the parser on MacOS or Linux, do `stack run < input.py`.

To run the tests, do `stack test`.
